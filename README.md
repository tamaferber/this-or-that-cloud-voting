**This or That – Serverless Cloud Voting System
Project Overview**

This project implements a cloud-native, serverless, event-driven voting system based on a microservices architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The system allows users to participate in a simple “This or That” poll, where each poll presents a single question with two possible options (A or B).
Users can vote through a public interface, while administrators can manage polls and observe near real-time voting results via a dedicated dashboard.

The project was developed as part of the Cloud Computing course, with a strong focus on:
    
    Serverless architecture
    
    Event-driven workflows
    
    Managed cloud services
    
    Scalability and fault tolerance
    
    Security and least-privilege design
    
    Clean separation of responsibilities

**System Features**
  Public User Interface
        
        Hosted via Amazon S3 + CloudFront
        
        Displays the currently active poll
        
        Allows a user to submit a single vote
        
        Vote submission is protected against duplicate voting

  Admin Interface

      Allows manual creation of new polls
      
      Displays aggregated voting results
      
      Results update automatically as votes are received

**Architectural Principles**
The system follows these architectural principles:
    
    Serverless – No servers or infrastructure management
    
    Microservices – Each responsibility is implemented as a separate Lambda function
    
    Event-Driven – The system reacts to API calls and data changes
    
    Stateless Compute – All state is stored in managed services
    
    Scalable by Design – AWS-managed services scale automatically
    
    Highly Available – No single point of failure in the voting flow
    
    Secure by Design – IAM least privilege, isolated services, HTTPS-only access

**AWS Services Used**
    AWS Lambda – Business logic and microservices
    
    AWS Step Functions – Orchestration of the voting workflow
    
    Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API) – Public and admin endpoints
    
    Amazon DynamoDB – Persistent storage
    
    Amazon DynamoDB Streams – Event source for real-time updates
    
    Amazon API Gateway (WebSocket) – Real-time result distribution
    
    Amazon S3 + CloudFront – Frontend hosting and delivery
    
    Amazon CloudWatch – Logging and monitoring
    
    AWS IAM – Access control and security enforcement

**High-Level System Flow**
    A user accesses the public voting page via CloudFront.
    
    The frontend fetches the currently active poll using an HTTP API.
    
    The user submits a vote (POST /vote).
    
    API Gateway forwards the request to a vote-wrapper Lambda.
    
    The vote triggers an AWS Step Functions state machine.
    
    The workflow validates the vote and prevents duplicate submissions.
    
    Valid votes are persisted in DynamoDB and results counters are updated.
    
    DynamoDB Streams trigger a real-time update to connected clients via WebSocket.
    
    The admin dashboard reflects updated results automatically.

**Voting Workflow (Step Functions)**
The voting process is orchestrated using AWS Step Functions, ensuring a clear and reliable execution flow:

  ValidateVote

    Verifies required parameters
    
    Checks for duplicate voting using VotesLog

  Decision State

    Rejects invalid or duplicate votes

  SubmitVote

    Writes the vote to VotesLog
    
    Updates aggregated counters in GameResults

  End State

    Successful completion or rejection

This orchestration ensures:

    Deterministic execution
    
    Clear separation of concerns
    
    Easy debugging and monitoring

**Data Model Overview**
DynamoDB Tables

Polls

  Stores poll definitions

VotesLog

  Records individual votes

  Prevents duplicate voting

GameResults

  Stores aggregated counters per poll

WebSocketConnections

  Tracks active client connections for real-time updates

**Real-Time Updates**
Real-time result updates are implemented using an event-driven pattern:

  Updates to GameResults trigger DynamoDB Streams
  
  A dedicated Lambda (results-stream-handler) processes stream events
  
  Updated results are broadcast to connected clients via WebSocket API

This approach avoids polling and ensures efficient real-time communication.

**Security Considerations**
Security was treated as a core requirement throughout the system design:

  Least-privilege IAM roles per Lambda
  
  Separation between public voting APIs and admin functionality
  
  No direct database access from the frontend
  
  HTTPS-only access enforced via CloudFront
  
  Explicit CORS handling through dedicated preflight Lambdas
  
  Full logging and observability via CloudWatch

A detailed threat model including Attack Surface, Attack Vectors, and Mitigations is documented in the project documentation.

**Testing and Validation**
The system was validated through:

  Manual end-to-end testing of the voting flow
  
  Step Functions execution inspection
  
  DynamoDB state verification
  
  Duplicate vote prevention tests
  
  CORS and API Gateway validation
  
  Real-time update verification via WebSocket

**Summary**
This project demonstrates a complete serverless, event-driven cloud system, implementing:

Clean microservice separation

Orchestrated workflows with Step Functions

Reliable persistence with DynamoDB

Real-time updates using DynamoDB Streams and WebSockets

Secure, scalable, and maintainable cloud architecture
